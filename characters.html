                            The reason this tracker was made. 15 year old with undiagnosed autism and many hyperfixations that he tends to ramble about, which annoys the people around him. Most people are put off by his incredible levels of autism, so they tend to ban him from groups and servers on Discord. He hates this and deems these people "opps," or rather, a term he coined, "Antievanists". There is no formal group of "Proevanists," but some people do support him.

                            Owner of a Turning Red Discord server. Initially disliked Evan due to his autism, but then banned Evan after Roger impersonated him and posted obscene content while posing as Evan. The real Evan was eventually unbanned, but then had multiple autistic freakouts over being disliked in the Turning Red community and after he was banned from using the word "sus". TechGkN also trolled Evan by making him think it was possible for a Discord bot to electrocute him. This guy still owns his own Discord server. Apparently also sent Evan porn of the Doomer wojak.

According to Elxde, Busiedmold was slightly more autistic than Evan, but also slightly smarter than him. According to Evan, Busiedmold was also doxxed by the trolls.

                            Owner of a group chat that Awesome added Evan to. He began taking a backseat approach to bullying Evan, mostly observing and rarely intervening. He eventually wound up blocking Evan. Still finds certain Evan moments funny, but wants nothing to do with him. Evan still brings Waddles up sometimes, mostly in the context of Waddles being a "leader" of some sort (probably because he owned a group chat at one point). Also, he's a Mexican beaner.
